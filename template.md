## Summary

Brief explanation of your RFC

## Motivation

Why are you making this RFC? What use cases does it have? What is the
expected outcome?

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for
someone familiar with Fomantic to understand and for someone familiar with
the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and
corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new
terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please concider:
 - implementation code, in both terms code size/complexity and time
 - the impact on teaching people Fomantic
 - integration with other planned/existing features
 - cost of migrating existing Fomantic projects (is it a breaking change?)

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

Is your RFC backwards compatible? If not explain any issues this may cause. 

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing
this? Is there another way to achieve the same result without implementing
this RFC? 

## Open Questions

Any open questions about the RFC which may still be TBD.
